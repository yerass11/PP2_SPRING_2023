"""
Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

'hello' is the same as "hello".

You can display a string literal with the print() function:
"""

print("Hello")
print('Hello')

#You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:

#You can use three double quotes:

a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
print(a)

#*  Note: in the result, the line breaks are inserted at the same position as in the code.
